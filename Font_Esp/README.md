## Why?

To avoid copyright issues for uploading the font, I upload an explanation and a patch to get the original changed.

This will also give you the font I use without having to patch the whole game.

# how to use

If you just want the new font, take the font file from the game ( ID000029) and patch it with:
EditFont.xdelta

After that, you'll need to load "Font_Esp.tbl" in your armips script. 
**Save both files (armips and table) with utf8 encoding**


# What if I want a completely new font?
Follow the RE_Guide and make your own edits to the font and the original table from:

**Don't forget to save the tbl with utf8 encoding if you have non ascii characters.**
