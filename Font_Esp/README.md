## Why?

To avoid copyright issues for uploading the font, I upload an explanation and a patch to get the original changed.

This will also give you the font I use without having to patch the whole game.

# how to use

If you just want the new font, take the font file from the game ( id000029) and patch it with:
font_esp.xdelta (To Do)

After that, you'll need to load "Font_Esp.tbl" in your armips script. 
**Save both files (armips and table) with utf8 encoding**


# What if I want a completely new font?
Follow the RE_Guide and make your own edits to the font and the original table https://www.romhacking.net/documents/765/
**Again, save both files (armips and table) with utf8 encoding**
