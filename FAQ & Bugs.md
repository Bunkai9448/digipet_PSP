#                                   GAME INFO (FAQs)
===============================================================================

- <details>Press "O+X" simultaneously to display the sound menu.</details> 

- <details>Use Up and Left d-pad/arrows to display the digivice watch.</details> 

- <details>The wifi menu is weird even when you read the japanese version, the explanation of this comes from 
discarded lines that would double the windows prompted. Again, this is from the original japanese version.</details>  

- <details>O and X buttons are mapped like they were in the japanese version.  
*Use X to see your total steps and the remaining ones. Use O to display the menu*</details> 

- <details>Versus battles are all automated, you can only choose your digimon and phase at the begining of 
each battle.
*This battles can be done at any hour of the day, no sleep time is inforced.*</details> 

- <details>Cheer your digimon as soon as you choose to attack to win the battle, during the "ready" phase. 
The result is decided during that phase.</details> 

- <details>If you press X at the starting of a battle (before the menu appears), you will be prompted with the lose 
animation, and your digimon will be exhausted. That's a game feature, not related to the patch.  
*When you lose a battle, a line will appear in the bottom, you need to open the menu with O and do as asked.*
</details> 

- <details>You can obtain only the original 8 digion partners, and all of them have the same number of 
digi-evo phases.  
<summary>The number of wins to unlock each one is as follows:</summary>10 > 15 > 20 </details> 
*There are a total of 52 digimons, including the digimon partners.*

- <details>Each partner is obtained when you find them in the "Help" mode that appears seemingly random during 
walking time. You need to win the battle for them to join, and there are certain moments when the help doesn't 
return a partner (this is due to the original programing, not related to the patch).</details>  

- <details>To change your walking digimon, open the menu and check its parameters, your last digimon checked will be the one 
walking.

- <details>The Game has 7 Areas, below you can see the minimum steps/clicks required to finish each one. Steps 
required:<summary>10 000 > 12 000 > 14 000 > 16 000 > 18 000</summary></details> 
*There is an incomplete cheat for that in this repo, called Cheat4steps.txt. It was done during the first area, then 
 discarded to focus on actually working on the patch. However, it works in a sense*

- <details>The final boss of each area is fixated, they are as follows:<summary>Kuwagamon >  > Etemon > Metaltyranomon</summary></details> 
*However the other battled digimon are random.*
