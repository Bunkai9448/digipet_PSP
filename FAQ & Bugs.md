===============================================================================

- Press "O+X" simultaneously to display the sound menu.

- Use Up and Left d-pad/arrows to display the digivice watch.

- The wifi menu is weird even when you read the japanese version, the explanation of this comes from 
discarded lines that would double the windows prompted. Again, this is from the original japanese version. 

- O and X buttons are mapped like they were in the japanese version.  
*Use X to see your total steps and the remaining ones. Use O to display the menu.*

- Versus battles are all automated, you can only choose your digimon and phase at the begining of each battle.  
*This battles can be done at any hour of the day, no sleep time is inforced.*

- Cheer your digimon as soon as you choose to attack to win the battle, during the "ready" phase.  
The result is decided during that phase.

- If you press X at the starting of a battle (before the menu appears), you will be prompted with the lose 
animation, and your digimon will be exhausted. That's a game feature, not related to the patch.  
*When you lose a battle, a line will appear in the bottom, you need to open the menu with O and do as asked.*

- There is a total of 52 digimons, including the digimon partners. All partners have the same number of 
digi-evo phases.<details><summary>See the number of wins required to unlock each phase here:</summary>
10 > 15 > 20 </details> 

- There is a total of 8 + 1 digimon partners.

- After the first, each partner joins when you find them in "Help" mode that appears seemingly random during 
walking time. You need to win the battle for them to join, and there are certain moments when the help doesn't 
return a partner (this is due to the original programing, not related to the patch).
*The area you're in doesn't matter for the random HELP mode to appear, you can get various before moving to other area 
if you want.*

- To change your walking digimon, open the menu and check its parameters, your last digimon used/checked will be 
the one walking.

- The Game has 7 Areas, below you can see the minimum steps/clicks required to finish each one.<details><summary>
See all Steps required here:</summary>10 000 > 12 000 > 14 000 > 16 000 > 18 000 > 20 000 > 22 000</details> 
*There is an incomplete cheat for that in this repo, called Cheat4steps.txt. It was done during the first area, then 
 discarded to focus on actually working on the patch. However, it works in a sense.* 

- Battled digimon are random within a range for each area. However, the final boss of each area is 
fixated.<details><summary>See all Bosses here:</summary>Kuwagamon >  > Etemon > Metaltyranomon > 
  MetalSeadramon > Megadramon > Mugendramon & Apocalymon</details>
