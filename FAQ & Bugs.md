#                         GAME INFO
================================================================

- If you press X at the starting of a battle (before the menu appears), you will be prompted with the lose animation, and your digimon will be exhausted. That's a game feature, not related to the patch.  
*When you lose a battle, a line will appear in the bottom, you need to open the menu with O and do as asked.*

- The Game has 7 Areas, below you can see the minimum steps/clicks required to finish each one.  
Steps required: 1st - 10 000 > 2nd - 12 000 > 3rd - 14 000 > 4th - 16 000 

- To Do, Find how to display the sound menu.

- Use Up and Left d-pad/arrows to display the digivice watch.

- Versus battles are all automated, you can only choose your digimon and phase at the begining of each battle.
*This battles can be done at any hour of the day, no sleep time is inforced.*

- Cheer your digimon as soon as select to attack to win the battle, during the "ready" phase. 
The result is decided during that phase.

- You can only obtain the original 8 digion partners, and all of them have the same number of digi-evo phases. 
The number of wins to unlock each one is as follows: 10 > 15 > 20 

- Each partner is obtained when you find them in the "Help" mode that appears seemingly random during walking time.  
You need to win the battle for them to join, and there are certain moments when the help doesn't return a partner. 

- The final boss of each area is fixated, they are as follows: Kuwagamon >  > Etemon  
*However the other battled digimon are random.*

- There are a total of 52 digimons.

- The wifi menu is weird even when you read the japanese version, the explanation of this comes from discarded lines 
that would double the windows prompted. Again, this is from the original japanese version.

- O and X buttons are mapped like they were in the japanese version.  
*Use X to see your total steps and the remaining ones. Use O to display the menu*
