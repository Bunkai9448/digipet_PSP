# digipet_PSP

This repository contains files to reverse engineering (RE from now on) the files from the "digivice ver. portable psp" ("The game" from now on), and use that to to create a patch for translating the game.

Currently there's not much explanation about the RE process, that's because the project is a work in progress.

Warning: Some files and/or methods of this project might be only as a POC, hence they lead nowhere further on. If you don't know why a file is there, it's probably that.

## Considerations

- You must provide your own game files. Do not ask here for them.
